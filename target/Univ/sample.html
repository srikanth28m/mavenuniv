Location & Transportation

Our campus is located in Fairfax, Virginia - one of the safest and highly developed counties in the United States, and just minutes away from the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. 

There are many ways to reach Virginia International University:

VIU Shuttle
 
Virginia International University provides a free shuttle service to VIU students and staff Monday through Saturday. The shuttle runs from our Village Drive Campus to the Vienna/Fairfax Metro Station at the end of the Orange Line with stops at many popular apartment complexes, as well as Fair Oaks Mall.

You can check out the Shuttle Schedule online or via the goVIU app for iPhone and Android.

Public Transport 
 
VIU students and visitors can take advantage of the local metro and bus system, WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority), which serves the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area along its main routes.

The most convenient bus route to VIU is C1 going from Dunn Loring Metro Station (Orange Line):

Take the C1 bus at the Bus Bay F towards Government Center Parkway.
In approximately 40 minutes, get off the C1 bus at the “Government Center Pkwy & Lower Park” stop in front of Wegmans store.
Continue walking in the same direction on Government Center Pkwy and take the next left turn onto Monument Drive.
Walk about 5 minutes until you reach VIU campus on Village Drive.
